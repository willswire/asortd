    <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
    <p>Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through
      the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is
      repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or
      larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical
      for most problems even when compared to insertion sort.  Bubble sort can be practical if the input is in mostly
      sorted order with some out-of-order elements nearly in position.</p>
