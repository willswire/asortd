# Project Proposal

- The names of all members of your group and a team name by which you will be known moving forward in the class:
  - Muhammet Aydin
  - Scott Benton
  - Charles Lambert
  - Connor Onweller
  - William Walker
- A brief (one or two paragraph) overview of what the project is and what to expect from it when it is finished.
- A brief (one or two paragraph) discussion of how you intend to implement the project (i.e. what technologies, code layout, general design guidelines).
  - We intend to utilize the basic web technologies demonstrated in class.  We plan to implement functionality offered by the jQuery library for basic implementation of sorting algorithms.  Visual elements (such as icons and color palettes) will be supplied from open source repositories on the internet, yet the overall layout/design will be our own.
- A brief listing of who will be responsible for what during the design and development process.
