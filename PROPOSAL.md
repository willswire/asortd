# Project Proposal

- The names of all members of your group and a team name by which you will be known moving forward in the class:
  - Muhammet Aydin
  - Scott Benton
  - Charles Lambert
  - Connor Onweller
  - William Walker
- A brief (one or two paragraph) overview of what the project is and what to expect from it when it is finished.
  - The intent of this project is to design and generate a sorting algorithm generator; this will serve to educate visitors of the site on the different algorithms implemented and provide for the possibility of professors using the site in lessons.  The system will be modular with the ability to implement new algorithms for the most desired sorts.  Allowing for key features such as speed-variability and step-based processes will bolster the educational value of this software by allowing students (and professors) the opportunity to move through the selected sort at virtually any rate.  Other features such as personalized/random array-value selection as well as a streamlined UI (with implementation techniques discussed below) will also provide the user with a more simplistic experience with the goal of optimizing the value of the resulting product.  With the introduction of the above features our goal is to create a streamlined and educational sort visualizer.
- A brief (one or two paragraph) discussion of how you intend to implement the project (i.e. what technologies, code layout, general design guidelines). 
- A brief listing of who will be responsible for what during the design and development process.
